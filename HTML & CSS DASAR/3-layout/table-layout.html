                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting        
                industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the  
                1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
                make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but 
                also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
